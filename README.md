Installation
Make sure you have R version 4.x installed, then download or clone this repository to a directory on your computer.

Running the code
To replicate this anlaysis, start an R or RStudio session in the directory where you've downloaded this repository. In the R console, run:

library(targets)
tar_make()
And it will begin the workflow provided in the _targets.R file. You can cancel the run at any time, and any completed targets will be skipped the next time you run tar_make().

When the workflow is finished, it will place figures and tables in the data/ folkder.

The Targets package gives many ways to examine your run of the workflow. For a useful flowchart showing status and execution time, try: tar_visnetwork(targets_only = TRUE, label = 'time').
